The worldwide Freecycle Network is made up of many individual groups across the 
globe. It's a grassroots movement of people who are giving (and getting) stuff 
for free in their own towns. 

This application is a server process that polls the Freecycle Newham page at 
regular intervals and tweets any new messages to the @FreecycleNewham Twitter 
account. I wrote it because there is currently no official Twitter feed for 
Freecycle and I thought it would be a useful thing to have. It is an unofficial 
application and is not endorsed or supported by the Freecycle organisation.

This code is provided for reference only. You don't need to run it yourself, 
there is already an instance running - just follow @FreecycleNewham for the 
latest posts. The application will in any case not run unless you add the oAuth 
properties for a real Twitter application to the twitter4j.properties 
configuration file.
